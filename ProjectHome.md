The openASC project is a system which is used to control a big ham radio station. Everything from changing antennas to rotating towers/antennas and also enables the ability to remote control a station on-line.

The project was created by SM2WMV to be used at his contest station SJ2W (http://www.sj2w.se) but is open for anybody who wants to join the project.

Here is a report I wrote for a course in school, which describes the system in more detail,
