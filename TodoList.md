# Todo - software #

## Overall ##
  * Implement a bootloader that works over the bus interface

## openASC box ##
  * ~~Fix manual band change to work properly~~
  * ~~Figure out how to implement band decoding in general~~
  * ~~Implement automatic freq decoding of ICOM~~
  * ~~Implement automatic freq decoding of KENWOOD~~
  * Implement automatic freq decoding of YAESU
  * ~~Implement automatic band change from BCD~~
  * ~~Fix so that the sequencer timings can be configured properly~~
  * ~~Implement resend etc into the internal communication protocol~~
  * ~~Evaluate if we should increase time slots in the communication protocol, and maybe also decrease the amount of interrupts generated by the timer handling this. This to make the protocol more robust since we don't have any critical timing issues anymore.~~
  * ~~Implement the array sub menu~~
  * ~~Implement the stack sub menu~~
  * ~~Implement the "inhibit" signals to the driver modules~~
  * Implement the TX/RX mode
  * ~~Add more available functions to the external keypad~~
  * ~~Work on rotator support~~
  * Add option to change resolution of the rotator knob
  * Implement broadcast error messages which are logged by the computer listening to the bus.
  * ~~Implement more error messages in the box which can be viewed from the menu system~~
  * ~~Work to implement more on the sequencer like what to do when radio transmits (sense input), computer PTT etc.~~
  * ~~Implement so that internal FETs can be switched from the configuration settings, maybe use address 0? So 12@0 would activate output 12 on the main-board. This way we can also control the AUX outputs on the 2nd floor~~
  * Implement code to handle the I2C external communication
  * ~~Clean up code~~
  * ~~Implement a ping list with timeout. So if a PING hasn't been received from a box within a certain amount of time one should get warned, even inhibit lock if it is an "active" module.~~
  * ~~Implement the support of band inhibits so that one cannot select the same band as another box.~~
  * Consider moving the sequencer events to be called from the interrupt, to make the timing more reliable. Maybe just look at EVENT id and filter out everything which is not from the sequencer.
  * ~~Implement the option to set the AUX 1, AUX 2 button functions (?) We can make this work just like the external keyboard.~~
  * Move the menu system strings into the program memory to save RAM
  * ~~Make the a new box create typical default settings for runtime\_settings etc at startup.~~
  * ~~Add a message which is broadcasted several times when a box is started. That way if there is an error in a box and it reboots, all the driver cards can deactivate the outputs set by that openASC box. Broadcast it maybe three times to make sure that all cards have heard the "announcement".~~

## Driver modules ##
  * ~~Implement the inhibit signal from the openASC box~~
  * Implement TX/RX mode ability
  * ~~Implement timeouts of all I/O if no ping has been received in a certain amount of time from a device. Should also send an broadcast error message.~~
  * ~~Implement the deactivation of outputs from the address, of a broadcast message of a newly started box~~

## Rotator boards ##
~~Finish the hardware first...~~

## PC Configuration software ##
  * ~~Finish the sub menu support~~
  * Fix so it warns if the output strings are too long in the configuration part
  * ~~Fix so that the sequencer timing sends its settings properly~~
  * ~~Fix so that we can activate/deactivate the SWR alarm option, should be possible to configure it to react to active low/high?~~
  * ~~Implement the option to set the AUX 1, AUX 2 button functions (?), use same routines as external keypad to save work.~~
  * Fix so that we can configure what the AUX LED should indicate
  * ~~Implement so that the create\_eeprom() is called at the beginning of when the configuration software sends its settings~~


# Todo - Hardware #

## openASC box ##
  * ~~Test all the different radio interface levels on the 2nd floor~~
  * ~~Evaluate the filters for the communication bus~~

## Rotator board ##
  * ~~Go through this design again~~
  * ~~Fix the wrong design with the backup capacitor~~
  * ~~Evaluate that the schmitt-triggered inputs work properly~~
  * ~~Add a MAX232 serial chip to get easier way to interface it with rotators that have serial port, and also to configure it easier.~~
